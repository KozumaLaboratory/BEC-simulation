# Matsui et al. (2025) Fig. 4B — N_atoms scan. The one parameter their release
# is DEMONSTRABLY inconsistent about.
#
# Their shipped setup_parameters says Ntot = 3.5e4; the published curves total
# 49999.9. We assumed 5e4 because that is what the data says, but the couplings
# in the run that produced the data are not observable from the data — every
# coupling scales with N, and the plotted populations are absolute numbers that
# could have been produced at one N and reported at another.
#
# All of c_dd, c0 and c1 scale linearly with N here, so this is a single axis.
# Scaling: mu ∝ c0^(2/5) ∝ N^(2/5), n_peak = mu/c0 ∝ N^(-3/5), so the dipolar
# mean field c_dd*n_peak ∝ N^(2/5) — going 5e4 -> 3.5e4 weakens it by 13 %.
# That is the right size and the right direction for the ~20 % transfer excess.
# It is the WRONG direction for the centre, which is the whole puzzle: no single
# scalar moves both the way the data demands.
#
# Positive control: the two arms MUST differ. If they do not, the axis did not
# apply and the null means nothing — the lesson from gs_c1ratio_probe.experiment.jl.
#
# Target (measured off test/fixtures/matsui2025/dataset_fig4_theo.csv by
# `resonance_dip`, pinned in test/validation/test_matsui_fig4_dip.jl):
#     their simulation : dip centre -2.5495 nT, half-depth width 15.0224 nT
#     their experiment : dip centre -3.2048 nT, half-depth width 14.5414 nT
#
# Parameters reconstructed from time.f90 in Zenodo 17303925, NOT read off it:
# the shipped `setup_parameters` carries Ntot = 3.5e4 where the published curves
# total 5.0e4, and initial.f90 builds its ground state with cc0_eff = 1 /
# cc1_eff = 0 against time.f90's cc0_eff = 0.5 / cc1_eff = 50. See
# docs/validation/parameter_contract_with_Ueda.md §0.4.
#
#   N = 5.0e4, m_F = -6, (ω_x, ω_y, ω_z) = 2π·(110, 110, 130) Hz
#   cc0_eff = 0.5 with cc1 = cc0/36  ⇔  our c1_ratio = 1/36 under the
#     c₀ + 36c₁ = 4π(a_s/a_ho)N constraint (verified: both give c₀ = 2343.63)
#   ZeemanQ = 1.0 Hz, a LITERAL input in their code — not derived from |B|².
#     q/h = 1 Hz moves the m=-6 → -5 spacing by 11 Hz out of 42.3, i.e. 0.68 nT
#     of resonance position. It is not optional.
#   B: 10.4 mG ramped to the target with τ = 50 µs, then held; 5 ms total.
#   Loss-free (their L3loss = 0 AND L3loss_eff = 0).
# NO loss block — their Fig. 2/4 theory curves are loss-free.
# m=-6 → -5 transfer is DRIVEN by DDI, not seeded
# of the hold — point_001's saved psi cannot be trusted
