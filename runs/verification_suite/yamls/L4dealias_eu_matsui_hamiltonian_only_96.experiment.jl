# L4 — Eu-151 Matsui Hamiltonian-only 96³ (high-resolution convergence)
# Anomaly seen at 32/48/64: Fz_drift(32) ≈ Fz_drift(48) = +1.91e-3,
# Fz_drift(64) = +1.23e-2 (6× larger). Possible explanations:
#   (a) 64 captures high-k DDI modes 32/48 alias out → 96 should match 64 or exceed
#   (b) 32/48 share a low-resolution plateau, true answer is closer to 64 → 96 ≈ 64
#   (c) seed_amplitude noise spectrum interacts with grid resolution → 96 differs
# This run distinguishes (a) from (c) by adding one more grid resolution.
