# 64^3 long-time endpoint ensemble -- arm `rotating`, seed 1003.
#
# omega_perp = 1.0, Omega = -0.7 during the 100 omega_ref^-1 hold, grid 64^3.
#
# ONE ARM PER FILE, on purpose. `run_experiment` has no point selection -- it runs a
# whole `scan:` and skips points already on disk -- so a `scan:` over seeds
# cannot be split across array tasks, and a walltime kill mid-scan would leave
# the tail unrun. Sequentially, 8 arms x ~4.5 h exceeds any walltime.
#
# `noise_seed` is on pipeline[1], the step carrying `seed_amplitude`. IT IS READ
# NOWHERE ELSE: on the hold it is inert and every seed returns bit-identical
# numbers, which looks exactly like a deterministic observable. Measured
# 2026-08-19.
#
# WHY, SIZING and the REJECTION CRITERION: see README.md in this directory. The
# criterion is fixed BEFORE launch and must not be re-fitted to what lands.
#
# anti-aligned-seed: inherited from the base cell -- the EdH cascade only runs
#   from the Zeeman-HIGHEST stretched state (Kawaguchi-Saito-Ueda PRL 96,
#   080405). Authority: docs/campaign/edh_quench_polarisation_decision.md
